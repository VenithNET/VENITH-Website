                Welcome to Venith. Venith is owned and created by <a href="http://dc.venith.net/">Digital Cheese</a>, and <a href="http://home.venith.net">MattTheTekie</a>. Venith is a community hosted infrastructure project started in 2019. This was originally a collab between MattTheTekie and, <a href="http://github.com/Austcool-Walker">Austcool-Walker</a> which eventually evolved into something much bigger. We also believe in freedom, and a better model over other major platforms. MattTheTekie also helps out with a lot of the services being hosted or updating the websites whenever DC can't do it. We are also collabing with <a href="http://omada.cafe">omada.cafe</a>
