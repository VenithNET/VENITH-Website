# Minecraft in HTML
A website recreating the Minecraft original menus, made with pure HTML/CSS, no JavaScript at all. It's a half-experimental website as it's the first time I create a website of this kind, but it can be used for your own business.

It is oriented to be used on Minecraft server websites, such as your new and own server you've just paid to play Minecraft with your friends, but don't know what to put as a website? Well, this can be a quick solution.

## Pages included
- Play (getting the server IP and version)
- Info: this can be used as an information page with a "```<p>```" paragraph tag including some information about your server, or even with a "<iframe>" tag to show stats directly from websites that allow it like NameMC.
- Mods: include your servers' mod list and a button that downloads the whole package for new players.
- Discord/Social: this is just a page dedicated to your Discord server. Make a widget of it, get an invitation, and you are all done!
- About: here you can include some information of your server and the website version, though legal information like authors references may not be modified or removed.

There's another hiddden page that can also be used, the "Screenshots" one, here you can include some basic views of your server. It's hidden by default in the main menu with the comment tag (```<!-- -->```), remove them if you're using this page, otherwise it can't be accessed in any other way unless typing directly the URL, but players are not guessers lol.

## License
I didn't want to be strict with the license, it's subject to the terms of the MIT license. Honestly, I just want some credit in the website.
