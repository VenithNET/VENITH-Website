So here's the story. DSi Homepage is now DSi Homepage Archive. I am no longer working on the site, but I will keep it up for you guys. Why archive? Well, Some of you may know the site has been down for a few months. That is because my account was suspended (illegal content, not here now don't worry) and I couldn't get it unsuspended. I requested and they said no, and they had no backup (:O). Luckily, I used to be very good at making backups. However, that kind of stopped, the earliest backup I could find was 8/20/11. I thought this was going to be really old, but actually it doesn't look that bad. Development has been slow these past few years... I no longer plan to work here, and don't be surprised if I get suspended again, this may not be allowed (recreating the site). If you wish to support my current work, you can subscribe to youtube.com/quadrplax, where you can here my voice! (sorry, those of you without computer access) That's all I have to say. Cya!
