Hi. I am quadrplax, creator of <a href="http://3ds.dsihomepage.x10.mx/">3DS Homepage</a>, DSi Homepage, and <a href="http://pc.dsihomepage.x10.mx/">PC Homepage</a>. Here is how I got the user name I have: I was playing a flash game called <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/arcade-games/juggle.jsp">Juggle</a>. I had lost and was entering my name to put it on the highscore list. I started typing qwerty, but I decided to change it a little, and my username was born. My name is pronounced kwa-jro-plax (not kwad-er-plax). !SUPRISING FACT! 100% true: I was 10 when I started DSi Homepage and 11 when I started 3DS Homepage (on June 6, 2011)!
