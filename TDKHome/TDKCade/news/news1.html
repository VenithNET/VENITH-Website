        <p style="color: green;">Thanks to user Talravan, DSiCade now has new games!</p>
        <p style="color: green;">What's truly amazing is that we're not just talking about one new game.
        Not even two new games. But an amazing three new games in one update, from
        one author!</p>
        <p style="color: green;">Here's a quick rundown:</p>

        <p style="color: green;">HANGMAN: Guess the letters of the hidden word. But be careful! A wrong
        guess could cost a stickman his life...</p>
        <p style="color: green;">SUDOKU: The ever popular puzzle game from your Sunday newspaper is
        back on your DSi! Correctly align the numbers without repeats to win!</p>
        <p style="color: green;">PUZZLE: A simple, yet challenging puzzle game. Align the pieces to
        reveal the picture hidden in the jumble.</p>
        <p style="color: green;">Special thanks to Talravan for all his hard work. If you see him,
        make sure you tell him how much we love his new games! :-D</p>
