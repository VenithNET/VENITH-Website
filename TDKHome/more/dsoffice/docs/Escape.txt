"Nngh," I moaned. I stirred. "What happened?"

I opened my eyes. The lights were bright. I squinted, winced, and covered my eyes. Oof, not fun. Why was it so bright?

"Ooh, the patient's awake."

"Great!"

My eyes adjusted to the light. I was on the floor. I looked around. I was in some sort of doctor's office? Looked like a room for surgeries. What was I doing here?

I saw a red Acara and a blue Shoyru. Both looked at me. I quickly got up.

"Excuse me, where am I?" I asked. "Why am I here?"

"For your operation, sweetie," the Acara said sweetly. I got a creepy vibe from her.

"Operation? No, I'm healthy, I don't need one," I argued.

"Yes, picture of health," the Shoyru said. He smiled at me. "Which is why you're donating your organs."

I stepped back. "No, I'm using my organs."

"Not for long!" the Acara said cheerily. "Heart, lungs, brain-"

"You don't donate a brain." I backed up to the door. I tried to open it. Locked. Of course. "Let me out."

The Shoyru grabbed my arm. "Come now, let's hurry this up, we're behind schedule."

I struggled against his grip. "Hey! Stop!"

"Can we please quiet her?" the Acara asked.

"After she's settled," the Shoyru answered. He sat me on a table.

"Stop!" I ordered. "I'm not here for- Hey!" I fought against the Acara, who grabbed my other wrist. She forced it to the table and strapped it there. "Cut it out!"

"We need to keep you secure during the operation," the Shoyru said calmly. He strapped my other wrist to the table.

"Let me go! Help!" I kicked my feet. "Stop!" The Acara grabbed my ankles one at a time and strapped them down. "This isn't funny!"

"We aren't joking." The Shoyru looked at me.

I sat up a bit and looked at the Acara. She was pushing over a cart of wicked doctor supplies. I felt the blood from my face drain. "Stop it, I'm serious," I said nervously. I struggled against the restraints. "Let me go right now!"

I began to scream. I clenched my eyes shut and let out a shrill shriek. Suddenly, something was forced into my mouth. This big hard ball or something. I opened my eyes to see the Acara handling some sort of buckle attached to it. It was fastened around my head. I tried to scream, but almost no sound came out.

"Much better," the Shoyru said to the Acara.

"Agreed," the Acara replied.

The Shoyru forced my head down. Another strap went over my neck. Oof, it was tight like the others. I had a hard time breathing. "Alright, we can start."

The Acara pushed the cart over. She picked up this sort of thing. It looked like some sort of cast saw, but it had teeth. "What should we start with?"

"Hmm, why not the brain?"

My anger quickly turned into fear. I still continued to scream and try to speak and struggle as much as possible. The Shoyru continued to proceed as normal. He took this pencil and marked things on my forehead.

"Ready to start?" the Acara asked. She turned on the cast saw. It made a <i>whir</i>ring sound that caused me to be even more scared.

Three needled were put into my arm. I winced as the Shoyru said, "Hold on, figured we should take blood, too." I saw the Shoyru face the Acara. "Let's begin."

I tried as hard as possible to make noise or to move. My eyes focused on the cast saw as it approached my forehead. The look on the doctors' faces had no remorse. The fact that they were doing this didn't faze them.

There was a knock on the door. The Acara turned off the cast saw and went to open the door. I tried to scream to alert whoever was on the other side.

"Excuse me, I can see you're busy with a patient," a deep voice said.

"We're about to start," the Acara said.

"Oof, but you two are needed in the ICU."

"But what about the operation?" the Shoyru asked.

"Oh, I'll take care of that. Just go see what you are needed for."

The Shoyru and the Acara left the room. The door shut and was locked. Some footsteps wandered around the room. I was still breathing heavily. I tried to speak, to try to talk some sense into somebody. My life was on the line.

The Neopet loomed over me. I relaxed when I saw it was Kell. I almost passed out from relief.

"You look extremely scared," he said sweetly. He undid the strap holding my neck down. I breathed in as my breathing went back to normal. "Try to sit up." I did so. Kell undid the buckle around my head and took the ball out of my mouth. "You okay?"

"Kell, those doctors are crazy!" I cried. "I just woke up and they said that I was going to donate organs and they just started to-"

"Calm down." Kell removed the needles from my elbow and freed me from the restraints. "It's okay. Hold on, I want to bandage that arm."

"They were about to saw my head open." I pointed to the cart. "That cast saw was no more than a quarter inch from my forehead!" I was still breathing heavily. "I've never been more nervous in my life."

"Hey, don't panic. We still need to get out of here." Kell grabbed a bandage from the counter and wrapped it around my elbow. He helped me off of the table. "Did they hurt you?"

"No."
